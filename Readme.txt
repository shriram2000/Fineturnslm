The user wants to build a personalized product recommendation system using a Small Language Model (SLM) trained on this Kaggle fashion retail dataset. They have 6 CSV files with customer, product, transaction, and other retail data.
Let me think about the approach:

Data Understanding: They have:

customers.csv - customer demographics
products.csv - product catalog
transactions.csv - purchase history
stores.csv - store locations
employees.csv - employee data
discounts.csv - discount campaigns


Goal: Train an SLM to suggest products based on customer data/shopping history
Approach:

This is a recommendation system problem
We need to prepare training data from transaction history
Create features from customer attributes and purchase patterns
Train/fine-tune an SLM to generate product recommendations


Key Steps:

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature engineering (customer behavior, product attributes)
Creating training prompts/datasets for the SLM
Model selection (could use small models like GPT-2, BERT, or specialized recommendation models)
Training/fine-tuning
Evaluation and inference



Let me provide a comprehensive solution as a data engineer would approach this problem.
